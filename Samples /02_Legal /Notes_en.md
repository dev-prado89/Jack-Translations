### Translation Notes

In this fragment, the focus was on achieving legal-technical fluency rather than literal translation.  

The phrase **“entered into”** was rendered as *“se celebra”*, the standard formula in Spanish-language contracts, avoiding the unnatural literal form *“ingresado”*.  

The acronym **SLO (Service Level Objective)** was retained with its Spanish equivalent in parentheses, since it is commonly used in technical and legal documentation.  

**“Downtime”** was translated as *“tiempo de inactividad”*, the accepted term in SLA-related agreements.  

*“Credit compensation”* became *“compensación crediticia proporcional”*, the expression typically used in Spanish-speaking legal contexts.  

Lastly, *“without regard to its conflict-of-law principles”* was translated as *“sin tener en cuenta sus principios sobre conflictos de leyes”*, which is the standardized legal equivalent.
