### Translation Notes

While translating this fragment, some technical terms allow multiple valid equivalents.  
For example, *hard fork* can be literally translated as **bifurcación dura**, but within Spanish-language blockchain documentation, the standardized form is **bifurcación dura (*hard fork*)**, keeping the English term for clarity and consistency.

Other terms, such as *tokenomics*, have emerging Spanish variants (*tokenómica*). However, since the English form remains more widely recognized across the crypto-hispanic community, it was preserved in its original language.

These decisions aim to keep consistency with terminology used in Web3 and technical documentation, prioritizing clarity and recognition over literal translation.
