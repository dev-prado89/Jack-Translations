The HyperChain protocol leverages zk-SNARK proofs combined with optimistic rollups to enable scalable, trust-minimized layer-2 transactions.
Its modular architecture permits on-chain governance updates without hard forks, while zero-knowledge proofs ensure user privacy.

Furthermore, the tokenomics incorporate deflationary staking mechanisms, liquidity mining incentives, and dynamic fee adjustments based on network congestion.
All smart contracts are deployed following formal verification to guarantee correctness, and composable modules facilitate seamless integration with DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces.
